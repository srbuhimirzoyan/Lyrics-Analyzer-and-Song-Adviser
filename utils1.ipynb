      "1972–1991: Early life\n",
      "Marshall Bruce Mathers III was born on October 17, 1972,[4] in St. Joseph, Missouri, the only child of Marshall Bruce Mathers Jr. and Deborah Rae \"Debbie\" Nelson.[5][6][7] His mother nearly died during her 73-hour labor with him.[8] Eminem's parents were in a band called Daddy Warbucks, playing in Ramada Inns along the Dakotas–Montana border before their separation. Bruce left the family, moving to California[9] and having two other children: Michael and Sarah.[10] Debbie later had son Nathan \"Nate\" Kane Samara.[7] During his childhood, Eminem and Debbie shuttled between Michigan and Missouri, rarely staying in one house for more than a year or two and living primarily with family members. In Missouri, they lived in several places, including St. Joseph, Savannah, and Kansas City.[11][12]\n",
      "\n",
      "As a teenager, Eminem wrote letters to his father; according to Debbie, all came back marked \"return to sender\".[9] Friends and family remember Eminem as a happy child, but \"a bit of a loner\" who was often bullied. One bully, De'Angelo Bailey, severely injured Eminem's head (mentioned in his song \"Brain Damage\"); Debbie filed a lawsuit against the school in 1982, which was dismissed the following year because the Macomb County (Mich.) judge said the schools were immune from lawsuits.[8] Eminem spent much of his youth in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood.[9] He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten by black youths several times.[9] As a child he was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic-book artist before discovering hip hop.[13] Eminem heard his first rap song (\"Reckless\", featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronnie Polkinghorn, who later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkinghorn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking for days and did not attend his funeral.[9][14]\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem's home life was seldom stable; he frequently fought with his mother, whom a social worker described as having a \"very suspicious, almost paranoid personality\". When her son became famous, Debbie was unimpressed by suggestions that she was a less-than-ideal mother, contending that she sheltered him and was responsible for his success. In 1987, Debbie allowed runaway Kimberly Ann \"Kim\" Scott to stay at their home; several years later, Eminem began an on-and-off relationship with Scott.[8] After spending three years in ninth grade due to truancy and poor grades,[15] he dropped out of Lincoln High School at age 17. Although he was interested in English, he never explored literature (preferring comic books) and disliked math and social studies.[16] Eminem worked at several jobs to help his mother pay the bills, later maintaining that she often threw him out of the house anyway. When she left to play bingo, he would blast the stereo and write songs.[9]\n",
      "\n",
      "At age 14, Eminem began rapping with high-school friend Mike Ruby; they adopted the names \"Manix\" and \"M&M\", the latter of which evolved into \"Eminem\".[4][8] Eminem sneaked into neighboring Osborn High School with friend and fellow rapper Proof for lunchroom freestyle rap battles.[17] On Saturdays, they attended open mic contests at the Hip-Hop Shop on West 7 Mile, considered \"ground zero\" for the Detroit rap scene.[9] Struggling to succeed in a predominantly black industry, Eminem was appreciated by underground hip hop audiences.[4][18][19] When he wrote verses, he wanted most of the words to rhyme; he wrote long words or phrases on paper and, underneath, worked on rhymes for each syllable.[16] Although the words often made little sense, the drill helped Eminem practice sounds and rhymes.[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "1992–1997: Early career, Infinite and family struggles\n",
      "As Eminem's reputation grew, he was recruited by several rap groups; the first was the New Jacks. After they disbanded he joined Soul Intent, who released a single on their 1995 self-titled EP featuring Proof.[4] Eminem and Proof then teamed up with four other rappers to form The Dirty Dozen (D12), who released their first album Devil's Night in 2001.[9] Eminem had his first run-in with the law at age 20, when he was arrested for his involvement in a drive-by shooting with a paintball gun. The case was dismissed when the victim did not appear in court.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem was soon signed to Jeff and Mark Bass's FBT Productions, and recorded his debut album Infinite for their independent Web Entertainment label.[20] The album was a commercial failure upon its release in 1996.[21] One lyrical subject of Infinite was his struggle to raise his newborn daughter, Hailie Jade Scott Mathers, on little money. During this period, Eminem's rhyming style, primarily inspired by rappers Nas, Esham and AZ, lacked the comically violent slant for which he later became known.[22] Detroit disc jockeys largely ignored Infinite, and the feedback Eminem did receive (\"Why don't you go into rock and roll?\") led him to craft angrier, moodier tracks.[9] At this time Eminem and Kim Scott lived in a crime-ridden neighborhood, and their house was robbed several times.[9] Eminem cooked and washed dishes for minimum wage at Gilbert's Lodge, a family-style restaurant at St. Clair Shores.[23] His former boss described him as becoming a model employee, as he worked 60 hours a week for six months after Hailie's birth.[8] He was fired shortly before Christmas, and later said, \"It was, like, five days before Christmas, which is Hailie's birthday. I had, like, forty dollars to get her something.\"[9] After the release of Infinite, his personal problems and substance abuse culminated in a suicide attempt.[4] By March 1997 he was fired from Gilbert's Lodge for the last time, and lived in his mother's mobile home with Kim and Hailie.[8]\n",
      "\n",
      "1998–1999: Introduction to Slim Shady, The Slim Shady LP and rise to success\n",
      "Eminem attracted more attention when he developed Slim Shady, a sadistic, violent alter ego. The character allowed him to express his anger with lyrics about drugs, rape, and murder.[8] In the spring of 1997 he recorded his debut EP, the Slim Shady EP, which was released that winter by Web Entertainment.[9] The EP, with frequent references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability and violence, also explored the more-serious themes of dealing with poverty and marital and family difficulties and revealed his direct, self-deprecating response to criticism.[4] Hip-hop magazine The Source featured Eminem in its \"Unsigned Hype\" column in March 1998.[24]\n",
      "\n",
      "After he was evicted from his home, Eminem went to Los Angeles to compete in the 1997 Rap Olympics, an annual, nationwide battle rap competition. He placed second, and Interscope Records staff in attendance sent a copy of the Slim Shady EP to company CEO Jimmy Iovine. Iovine played the tape for record producer Dr. Dre, founder of Aftermath Entertainment and founding member of hip-hop group N.W.A. Dre recalled, \"In my entire career in the music industry, I have never found anything from a demo tape or a CD. When Jimmy played this, I said, 'Find him. Now.'\",and on the fourth & the last episode of The Defiant Ones Dre said, \"i was like: what the fuck!?, and who the fuck is that?\" expressing his shock towards Mathers' rapping talent, Although his associates criticized him for hiring a white rapper, he was confident in his decision: \"I don't give a fuck if you're purple; if you can kick it, I'm working with you.\"[9] Eminem had idolized Dre since listening to N.W.A. as a teenager, and was nervous about working with him on an album: \"I didn't want to be starstruck or kiss his ass too much ... I'm just a little white boy from Detroit. I had never seen stars, let alone Dr. Dre.\"[25] He became more comfortable working with Dre after a series of productive recording sessions.[26]\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem released The Slim Shady LP in February 1999. Although it was one of the year's most popular albums (certified triple platinum by the end of the year),[27] he was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper Cage.[28][29] The album's popularity was accompanied by controversy over its lyrics; in \"'97 Bonnie and Clyde\" Eminem describes a trip with his infant daughter when he disposes of his wife's body, and in \"Guilty Conscience\" which encourages a man to murder his wife and her lover. \"Guilty Conscience\" marked the beginning of a friendship and musical bond between Dr. Dre and Eminem. The label-mates later collaborated on a number of hit songs (\"Forgot About Dre\" and \"What's the Difference\" while also providing uncredited for, vocals on \"The Watcher\"\" from Dr. Dre's album 2001, \"Bitch Please II\" from The Marshall Mathers LP, \"Say What You Say\" from The Eminem Show, \"Encore/Curtains Down\" from Encore, and \"Old Time's Sake\" and \"Crack a Bottle\" from Relapse), and Dre made at least one guest appearance on each of Eminem's Aftermath albums.[30] The Slim Shady LP has been certified quadruple platinum by the RIAA.[31]\n",
      "\n",
      "2000–2002: The Marshall Mathers LP, lyrical conflicts and The Eminem Show\n",
      "The Marshall Mathers LP was released in May 2000. It sold 1,760,000 copies in its first week, breaking US records held by Snoop Dogg's Doggystyle for fastest-selling hip hop album and Britney Spears' ...Baby One More Time for fastest-selling solo album.[32][33] The first single from the album, \"The Real Slim Shady\", was a success despite controversies about Eminem's insults and dubious claims about celebrities (for example, that Christina Aguilera had performed oral sex on Fred Durst and Carson Daly).[34] In his second single, \"The Way I Am\", he reveals the pressure from his record company to top \"My Name Is\". Although Eminem parodied shock rocker Marilyn Manson in the music video for \"My Name Is\", they are reportedly on good terms; Manson is mentioned in \"The Way I Am\", appeared in its music video and has performed a live remix of the song with Eminem.[35] In the third single, \"Stan\" (which samples Dido's \"Thank You\"), Eminem tries to deal with his new fame, assuming the persona of a deranged fan who kills himself and his pregnant girlfriend (mirroring \"'97 Bonnie & Clyde\" from The Slim Shady LP).[18] Q called \"Stan\" the third-greatest rap song of all time,[36] and it was ranked tenth in a Top40-Charts.com survey.[37] The song has since been ranked 296th on Rolling Stone's \"500 Greatest Songs of All Time\" list.[38] In July 2000, Eminem was the first white artist to appear on the cover of The Source.[24] The Marshall Mathers LP was certified Diamond by the RIAA in March 2011 and sold 32 million copies worldwide.[39]\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem performed with Elton John at the 43rd Grammy Awards ceremony in 2001,[40] with the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD, an organization which considered Eminem's lyrics homophobic) condemning John's decision to perform with Eminem.[41] Entertainment Weekly placed the appearance on its end-of-decade \"best-of\" list: \"It was the hug heard 'round the world. Eminem, under fire for homophobic lyrics, shared the stage with a gay icon for a performance of \"Stan\" that would have been memorable in any context.\"[42] On February 21, the day of the awards ceremony, GLAAD held a protest outside the Staples Center (the ceremony's venue).[43] In 2001 Eminem appeared in the Up in Smoke Tour with rappers Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, Xzibit and Ice Cube[44] and the Family Values Tour with Limp Bizkit,[45] headlining the Anger Management Tour with Papa Roach, Ludacris and Xzibit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Eminem Show was released in May 2002. It was another success, reaching number one on the charts and selling over 1.332 million copies during its first full week.[27] The album's single, \"Without Me\", denigrates boy bands, Limp Bizkit, Dick and Lynne Cheney, Moby and others. The Eminem Show certified Diamond by the RIAA examines the effects of Eminem's rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter and his status in the hip-hop community, addressing an assault charge brought by a bouncer he saw kissing his wife in 2000. Although several tracks are clearly angry, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic found The Eminem Show less inflammatory than The Marshall Mathers LP.[46] L. Brent Bozell III, who had criticized The Marshall Mathers LP for misogynistic lyrics, noted The Eminem Show's extensive use of obscenity and called Eminem \"Eminef\" for the prevalence of the word \"motherfucker\" on the album.[47] The Eminem Show sold 30 million copies worldwide[39] and was the best-selling album of 2002.\n",
      "\n",
      "2003–2007: Encore, more lyrical conflicts and musical hiatus\n",
      "On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service said that it was \"looking into\" allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States.[48] The cause for concern was the lyrics of \"We As Americans\" (\"Fuck money / I don't rap for dead presidents / I'd rather see the president dead / It's never been said, but I set precedents\"), which was later released on a bonus CD with the deluxe edition of Encore.[49]\n",
      "\n",
      "Also in 2003 Eminem, a lifelong fan of Tupac,[50] provided production work for three tracks on the Tupac Resurrection soundtrack [51] He would follow this up the next year by producing 12 of the 16 tracks on Tupac's Loyal to the Game album.[51]\n",
      "\n",
      "Encore, released in 2004, was another success. Its sales were partially driven by the first single, \"Just Lose It\", which contained slurs about Michael Jackson. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of \"Just Lose It\", Jackson phoned the Los Angeles-based Steve Harvey radio show to report his displeasure with its video (which parodies Jackson's child molestation trial, plastic surgery and the 1984 incident when Jackson's hair caught fire during the filming of a commercial). In the song Eminem says, \"That's not a stab at Michael / That's just a metaphor / I'm just psycho\". Many of Jackson's friends and supporters spoke out against the video, including Stevie Wonder (who described it as \"kicking a man while he's down\" and \"bullshit\")[52] and Steve Harvey (who said, \"Eminem has lost his ghetto pass. We want the pass back\").[52] The video also parodied Pee-wee Herman, MC Hammer and Madonna during her Blond Ambition period.[53] \"Weird Al\" Yankovic, who parodied the Eminem song \"Lose Yourself\" on \"Couch Potato\" for his 2003 album Poodle Hat, told the Chicago Sun-Times about Jackson's protest: \"Last year, Eminem forced me to halt production on the video for my 'Lose Yourself' parody because he somehow thought that it would be harmful to his image or career. So the irony of this situation with Michael is not lost on me.\"[54] Although Black Entertainment Television stopped playing the video, MTV announced that it would continue to air it. The Source, through CEO Raymond \"Benzino\" Scott, called for the video to be pulled, the song removed from the album and Eminem to apologize publicly to Jackson.[55] In 2007 Jackson and Sony bought Famous Music from Viacom, giving him the rights to songs by Eminem, Shakira, Beck and others.[56]\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite its lead single's humorous theme, Encore explored serious subject matter with the anti-war song \"Mosh\". The song criticized President George W. Bush as \"This weapon of mass destruction that we call our president\", with lyrics including \"Fuck Bush\".[57] On October 25, 2004, a week before the 2004 US Presidential election, Eminem released the video for \"Mosh\" on the Internet.[58] In it, Eminem gathers an army (including rapper Lloyd Banks) of Bush-administration victims and leads them to the White House. When they break in, it is learned that they are there to register to vote; the video ends with \"VOTE Tuesday November 2\". After Bush's reelection, the video's ending was changed to Eminem and the protesters invading the White House during a speech by the president.[59] Also in 2004 Eminem launched a satellite music channel, Shade 45, on Sirius radio,[60] which was described by his manager as \"essentially a destination to get and hear things that other people aren't playing,\" [61]\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2005, industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering ending his rapping career after six years and several Multi-Platinum albums. Rumors began early in the year about a double album to be released late that year, entitled The Funeral;[62] the greatest hits album, entitled Curtain Call: The Hits, was released in December. In July the Detroit Free Press reported a possible final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inner circle as saying that he would embrace the roles of producer and label executive. The day of Curtain Call: The Hits's release, Eminem appeared on WKQI's \"Mojo in the Morning\" show. Denying that he was retiring, he suggested he would take a break as an artist: \"I'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don't know where my career is going ... This is the reason that we called it 'Curtain Call', because this could be the final thing. We don't know.\"[63] The following year, Eminem released Eminem Presents: The Re-Up on Shady Records.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2005, Eminem was ranked 58th in Bernard Goldberg's book, 100 People Who Are Screwing Up America.[64] Goldberg cited a 2001 column by Bob Herbert of The New York Times, in which Herbert wrote \"In Eminem's world, all women are whores and he is eager to rape and murder them\",[65] and the song \"No One's Iller\" from the Slim Shady EP as examples of Eminem's misogyny.[66] That summer Eminem began his first US concert tour in three years, with the Anger Management 3 Tour featuring 50 Cent, G-Unit, Lil Jon, D12, Obie Trice and The Alchemist. In August he canceled the European leg of the tour, later announcing that he had entered drug rehabilitation for treatment of a \"dependency on sleep medication\".[67] Curtain Call: The Hits was released December 6, 2005 by Aftermath Entertainment.[68] During its first week it sold nearly 441,000 copies in the US, and was Eminem's fourth consecutive number-one album on the Billboard Hot 200.[69] The album has been certified double platinum by the RIAA.[70]\n",
      "\n",
      "In September 2007, Eminem called New York radio station WQHT during an interview with 50 Cent, saying that he was \"in limbo\" and \"debating\" about when (or if) he would release another album: \"I'm always working – I'm always in the studio. It feels good right now, the energy of the label. For a while, I didn't want to go back to the studio ... I went through some personal things. I'm coming out of those personal things [and] it feels good.\"[71]\n",
      "\n",
      "2008–2009: Comeback, Relapse and Refill\n",
      "Eminem appeared on his Shade 45 Sirius channel in September 2008, saying: \"Right now I'm kinda just concentrating on my own stuff, for right now and just banging out tracks and producing a lot of stuff. You know, the more I keep producing the better it seems like I get 'cause I just start knowing stuff.\"[72] Interscope confirmed that a new album[73] would be released in spring 2009.[74] In December 2008, Eminem provided more details about the album, entitled Relapse: \"Me and Dre are back in the lab like the old days, man.

Relapse, the first, was released on May 19; its first single and music video, \"We Made You\", had been released on April 7.[76] Although Relapse did not sell as well as Eminem's previous albums and received mixed reviews, it was a commercial success and re-established his presence in the hip-hop world. It sold more than five million copies worldwide. During the 2009 MTV Movie Awards, Sacha Baron Cohen descended on the audience in an angel costume. He landed buttocks-first on Eminem, who stormed out of the ceremony; three days later, Eminem said that the stunt had been staged.[77] On October 30 he headlined at the Voodoo Experience in New Orleans, his first full performance of the year.[78] Eminem's act included several songs from Relapse, many of his older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, he announced on his website that Relapse: Refill would be released on December 21.

He said about producing his own music, \"Sometimes, I may get something in my head, like an idea or the mood of something that I would want, and I'm not always gonna get that by going through different tracks that other people have made.

The next day, in Warren, Michigan, he was arrested again for assaulting John Guerrera in the parking lot of the Hot Rock Café when he saw him kissing his wife.[227][228] Eminem recreated the Guerrera assault in \"The Kiss (Skit)\" on The Eminem Show. He was charged for possession of a concealed weapon and assault, pleaded guilty and received two years' probation; however, Guerrera's assault charge was dropped as part of the plea agreement.[229] On July 7, 2000, Kim attempted suicide by slashing her wrists,[230] and later sued Eminem for defamation after describing her violent death in \"Kim\".[228]\n",

Flaherty also said that he was \"disgusted\" when he read the lyrics of \"Kill You\", which includes the lines \"Slut, you think I won't choke no whore / Till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?\" Although public reaction to Flaherty's position was generally negative, with barring Eminem from the country considered a free-speech issue, Liberal MPP Michael Bryant suggested that hate crime charges be brought against Eminem for advocating violence against women in his lyrics.[231] Robert Everett-Green wrote in a Globe and Mail editorial, \"Being offensive is Eminem's job description\".[232] Eminem's Toronto concert went on as planned.[233]\n",

      "Health issues\n",
      "Eminem has spoken publicly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including Vicodin, Ambien and Valium.[248] According to friend and fellow D12 member Proof, Eminem first straightened out in 2002.[249] During the production of 8 Mile, Eminem, working 16 hours a day, developed insomnia. An associate gave him an Ambien tablet which \"knocked [him] out\", encouraging him to obtain a prescription. This was Eminem's first experience of drug addiction, which would affect him for several years. Near the end of production on Encore, he would \"just go into the studio and goof off [with] a pocketful of pills\". Eminem began taking the drugs to \"feel normal\", taking a \"ridiculous amount [...] I could consume anywhere from 40 to 60 Valium [in a day]. Vicodin, maybe 30\". The drugs would put him to sleep for no more than two hours, after which he would take more. Eminem's weight increased to 230 pounds (100 kg), and he was regularly eating fast food: \"The kids behind the counter knew me – it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad\". Eminem became less recognizable due to his weight gain, and once overheard two teenagers arguing about whether or not it was him: \"Eminem ain't fat.\"[16]\n",
      "\n",
      "In December 2007, Eminem was hospitalized after a methadone overdose he had first bought from a dealer who had told him it was \"just like Vicodin, and easier on [your] liver\". He continued to buy more, until he collapsed in his bathroom one night and was rushed to the hospital. Doctors there told him he had ingested the equivalent of four bags of heroin and was \"about two hours from dying\". After missing Christmas with his children, Eminem checked himself out of the facility weak and not fully detoxed. He tore the meniscus in his knee after falling asleep on his sofa, requiring surgery; after he returned home, he had a seizure. His drug use \"ramped right back to where it was before\" within a month. Eminem began to attend church meetings to get clean, but after he was asked for autographs he sought help from a rehabilitation counselor. He began an exercise program which emphasized running. Elton John was a mentor during this period, calling Eminem once a week to check on him.[16]\n",

      "In the book My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem, his mother stated that he has struggled with bipolar disorder throughout his life. She said it worsened after his ex-wife Kim Mathers gave birth to their daughter Hailie.[250]\n",

      "In April 2018, Eminem stated that he had been sober for 10 years.[251]\n",
      "\n",
      "Allegations of homophobia\n",
      "Some of Eminem's lyrics have been considered homophobic, and an Australian politician attempted to ban him from the country.[252] Eminem denies the charge, saying that when he was growing up words such as \"faggot\" and \"queer\" were used generally in a derogatory manner and not specifically toward homosexuals. During a 60 Minutes interview, journalist Anderson Cooper explored the issue:[253]\n",
      "\n",
      "When The New York Times asked him about the legalization of same-sex marriage in Michigan, Eminem replied: \"I think if two people love each other, then what the hell? I think that everyone should have the chance to be equally miserable, if they want\",[254] adding that his \"overall look on things is a lot more mature than it used to be\".[255]\n",
      "\n",
      "Several years later, Eminem was accused yet again of using homophobic words in his lyrics, and explained \"I don't know how to say this without saying it how I've said it a million times. But that word, those kind of words, when I came up battle-rappin' or whatever, I never really equated those words...\"[256]\n",

      "Legacy\n",
      "Eminem is considered one of the greatest hip-hop artists of all time. He was 83rd on Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists of All Time[257][258] and 79th on the VH1 100 Greatest Artists of All Time lists.[259] In 2010, MTV Portugal ranked Eminem the seventh-biggest icon in pop-music history.[260]\n",

      "He was the bestselling artist from 2000 to 2009 in the US according to Nielsen SoundScan,[261] and has sold 47.4 million albums in the country.[262] With global sales of 220 million records, he is one world's best-selling artists of all time.[263] Eminem has over ten billion views of his music videos on his YouTube Vevo page.[264] In 2010, Eminem's music generated 94 million streams (more than any other musical artist),[265] and in May 2014 Spotify called him the most-streamed artist of all time. According to Billboard, two of Eminem's albums are among the top-five bestselling albums from 2000 to 2010. \"Love the Way You Lie\" (11× platinum), \"Lose Yourself\" (10x platinum), and \"Not Afraid\" (10× platinum) are all certified diamond by the RIAA, making him the first artist with two then three digital diamond-certified songs in the US.[266][267] In the UK, Eminem has sold over 12.5 million records. As of June 2014, Eminem is the second-bestselling male artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era, the sixth-bestselling artist in the United States and the bestselling hip-hop artist, with sales of 45.1 million albums and 42 million tracks (including 31 million digital single certifications).[268][269][270][271] Eminem has had ten number-one albums on the Billboard 200: seven solo (five original albums and two compilations), two with D12 and one with Bad Meets Evil.[272] The Eminem Show, The Marshall Mathers LP, and Encore were ranked the third-, seventh- and fortieth-bestselling albums of the 2000–2009 decade, respectively.[273][274] Eminem has had 13 number-one singles worldwide. Eminem has been credited of rising the careers of rap proteges such as 50 Cent, Yelawolf, Stat Quo, Royce da 5'9\", Cashis, Obie Trice, Bobby Creekwater, and rap groups such as D12 and Slaughterhouse.\n",
      "\n",
      "In August 2011, Eminem was called the King of Hip-Hop by Rolling Stone, which analyzed album sales, R&B, hip-hop and rap chart positions, YouTube views, social media, concert grosses, industry awards and critical ratings of solo rappers who released music from 2009 to the first half of 2011.[275] His second major-label album, The Marshall Mathers LP, was the fastest-selling solo album in US history[32] and was ranked one of the greatest hip-hop albums of all time by Rolling Stone, Time and XXL.[276] Rolling Stone ranked it the seventh-best album of the first decade of the 21st century.[277] The album's third single (\"Stan\") is one of Eminem's most critically acclaimed songs, with Pitchfork calling it \"a cultural milestone\".[278]\n",

      "Honors and awards\n",
      "He shared the 2002 Academy Award for Best Original Song for his song Lose Yourself, co-written with Jeff Bass and Luis Resto. His Academy Award win made him the first rapper to receive this award.[313]\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem has received fifteen Grammy Awards, has been praised for his \"verbal energy\" and lyrical quality and was ranked ninth on MTV's Greatest MCs of All Time list.[314][315] In 2003, he was thirteenth on MTV's 22 Greatest Voices in Music list[316] and 82nd on Rolling Stone's Immortals list.[317] In 2008, Vibe readers named Eminem the Best Rapper Alive.[318][319]\n",

      "\"The Real Slim Shady\" (from Eminem's second Grammy-winning album, The Marshall Mathers LP) criticizes the awards in its second verse, with Eminem believing at the time that negative opinion of his material would prevent him from ever winning one.

      "Other ventures\n",
      "Shady Records and D12\n",
      "After Eminem's Multi-Platinum record sales, Interscope offered him his own label; he and Paul Rosenberg founded Shady Records in late 1999. Eminem signed his Detroit collective, D12, and rapper Obie Trice to the label and signed 50 Cent in a 2002 joint venture with Dr. Dre's Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre added Atlanta rapper Stat Quo to the Shady-Aftermath roster. DJ Green Lantern, Eminem's former DJ, was with Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent-Jadakiss feud forced him to leave the label. The Alchemist is currently Eminem's tour DJ. In 2005 Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater, and West Coast rapper Cashis to Shady Records.[15]\n",
      "\n",
      "On December 5, 2006, the compilation album Eminem Presents: The Re-Up was released on Shady Records. The project began as a mixtape, but when Eminem found the material better than expected he released it as an album. The Re-Up was intended to introduce Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater.[321] While he was recording Infinite, Eminem, Proof and Kon Artis assembled a group of fellow rappers now known as D12, short for \"Detroit Twelve\" or \"Dirty Dozen\", who performed in a style similar to Wu-Tang Clan.[322] In 2001 D12's debut album, Devil's Night, was released.[323] The first single from the album was \"Shit on You\", followed by \"Purple Pills\" (an ode to recreational drug use) and \"Fight Music\". \"Purple Pills\" was rewritten for radio and television, removing many of the song's references to drugs and sex, and renamed \"Purple Hills\".\n",
      "\n",
      "After their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio. They reunited in 2004 for their second album, D12 World, which included the hit singles \"My Band\" and \"How Come\". \"American Psycho 2\" featuring Cypress Hill member, B-Real, was another popular hit.[323] According to D12 member Bizarre, Eminem was not featured on his album Blue Cheese & Coney Island because \"he's busy doing his thing\".[324]\n",
      "\n",
      "In January 2014, Bass Brothers announced that D12 had returned to record at F.B.T. Studio and they were working on an album with Eminem on at least three songs. Bizarre reported that he was still part of the group and that the album was scheduled for a 2014 release.[325]\n",
      "\n",
      "Acting career\n",
      "After small roles in the 2001, film The Wash and as an extra in the 1998 Korn music video for Got the Life (during which he gave the band a demo tape), Eminem made his Hollywood debut in the quasi-autobiographical 2002 film 8 Mile. He said it was a representation of growing up in Detroit rather than an account of his life. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including \"Lose Yourself\" (which won an Academy Award for Best Original Song in 2003 and became the longest-running #1 hip hop single in history).[326] Eminem was absent from the ceremony, and co-composer Luis Resto accepted the award.[327]\n",
      "\n",
      "Eminem has voiced the video game 50 Cent: Bulletproof (as an aging, corrupt, Ebonics-speaking police officer) and guested on the Comedy Central television show Crank Yankers and a Web cartoon, The Slim Shady Show[328] He was signed to star in an unmade film version of Have Gun – Will Travel,[329] and was considered for the role of David Rice in the 2008 film Jumper.[330] Eminem had a cameo appearance, arguing with Ray Romano, in the 2009 film Funny People.\n",
      "\n",
      "He played himself in the Entourage season-seven finale \"Lose Yourself\" with Christina Aguilera.[331] Although Eminem was offered the lead role in the 2013 science-fiction film Elysium, he turned it down because director Neill Blomkamp would not change its location from Los Angeles to Detroit.[332] Eminem had a cameo appearance as himself in the 2014 film The Interview. During an interview with the main character, Dave Skylark (James Franco), Eminem satirically comes out as homosexual.[333]\n",
      "\n",
      "Memoirs\n",
      "Eminem's autobiography, The Way I Am, was published October 21, 2008. Detailing his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak and depression, it includes stories of his rise to fame, commentary about past controversies and original lyric sheets from \"Stan\" and \"The Real Slim Shady\".[334] An autobiography of Eminem's mother (My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem) was published the following month, in which Debbie Nelson describes her childhood and adolescence, meeting Eminem's father and her son's rise to (and struggles with) fame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Advertising and charity\n",
      "Eminem appeared in two commercials which were shown during Super Bowl XLV. In the first, a one-minute spot for Lipton's Brisk iced tea, he is a claymation figure.[335] In the second, a two-minute ad – the longest in Super Bowl history at the time – for the Chrysler 200, Eminem drives through Detroit (with \"Lose Yourself\" as the soundtrack) to his show at the Fox Theatre.[336][337]\n",

    "string1=\"As a teenager, Eminem wrote letters to his father; according to Debbie, all came back marked.[9] Friends and family remember Eminem as a happy child, but ho was often bullied. One bully, De'Angelo Bailey, severely injured Eminem's head (mentioned in his sone); Debbie filed a lawsuit against the school in 1982, which was dismissed the following year because the Macomb County (Mich.) judge said the schools were immune from lawsuits.[8] Eminem spent much of his youth in a working-class, primarily black, Detroit neighborhood.[9] He and Debbie were one of three white households on their block, and Eminem was beaten by black youths several times.[9] As a child he was interested in storytelling, aspiring to be a comic-book artist before discovering hip hop.[13] Eminem heard his first rap song (, featuring Ice-T) on the Breakin' soundtrack, a gift from Debbie's half-brother Ronnie Polkinghorn, who later became a musical mentor to him. When Polkinghorn committed suicide in 1991, Eminem stopped speaking for days and did not attend his funera\""
